# Dispensary Coupons
WordPress plugin that lets you add coupons to your dispensary website

Currently under active development. Version 1.0 of the plugin will be live in the official WordPress plugin repository soon.

**Requirements**

Although not required, Dispensary Coupons was built with the [WP Dispensary](http://www.wpdispensary.com) plugin to be installed and activated in order to work and does offer some added functionality for websites that are running the WPD plugin.

**Contribute**

Want to help this plugin get better? Issues and pull requests are more than welcomed :)
